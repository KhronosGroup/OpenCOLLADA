Requirements:
-------------

To run the COLLADAMax plugin you need a version of 3ds Max installed that 
matches the version your plugin has been build against.

Supported versions are:

3ds Max 2011   (32bit/64bit)
3ds Max 2012   (32bit/64bit)
3ds Max 2013   (32bit/64bit)
3ds Max 2014   (64bit)
3ds Max 2015   (64bit)
3ds Max 2016   (64bit)
3ds Max 2017   (64bit)

Install:
---------

Copy the plugin (ColladaMaxNew.dle) in the "plugins" directory of the 3dsMax 
installation folder.

If you compile the plugin yourself, you'll find it inside:
OpenCOLLADA\COLLADAMax\bin\win\[Win32 or X64]\.. folder

For example, if you have Max 2014 installed at "E:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2014\3dsmax.exe" then copy ColladaMaxNew.dle in the "E:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2014\plugins\" folder. Note this path is for a 64bit version. 32 bits applications are in "Program Files (x86)" folder.

After the next start of 3ds Max the plugin is available and can be found as 
"COLLADA NextGen" in the export dialog.
