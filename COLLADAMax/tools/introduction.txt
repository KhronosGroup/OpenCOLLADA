  @section intro Introduction  
  
  This is the complete API reference for the COLLADAMax exporter plugin and the COLLADAStreamWriter.
  
  @subsection colladamax  COLLADAMax
  COLLADAMax is a new implementation of a 3ds Max plug-in to export a Max scene or 
  parts of it to a <a href="http://www.collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/COLLADA">COLLADA</a> file, 
  released under an MIT-license.  In contrast to other existing 3ds Max  to COLLADA exporters, this 
  new plug-in does not store the COLLADA document in an intermediate data model but writes it 
  directly to file. This leads to a dramatic reduction of memory consumption and to a much better 
  performance.
  
  
  @subsection colladastreamwriter COLLADAStreamWriter
  The COLLADAStreamWriter is a library to simplify writing COLLADA files directly to a file, without 
  storing them in an intermediate data model.
