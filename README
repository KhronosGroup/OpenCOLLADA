COLLADAMax and COLLADAMaya are new implementation of a 3ds Max or Maya  plug-ins to export scene or 
parts of it to a COLLADA file, released under an MIT-license. 

In contrast to other existing COLLADA exporters, this new plug-ins do not store the
COLLADA document in an intermidiate data model but writes it directly to file. This leads to a dramatic 
reduction of memory consumption and to much a better performance.

For more information about the plug-ins and how to build them, please read the README files in 
COLLADAMax and COLLADAMaya directories.

For information about how to build OpenCOLLADA under linux and mac OSX usings SCons, please read the BUILD file.

NOTE: The COLLADA.sln solution, contained in this directory, exists only for development purposes.
      To build the NextGen plug-ins, please use the solutions in the COLLADAMax anf COLLADAMaya
      directories.
