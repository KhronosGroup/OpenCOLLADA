- validation with substitution groups
  * in COLLADA 1.4 that causes UNKNOWN ELEMENT errors
  * 1.4:
       <xs:element name="fx_profile_abstract" abstract="true">
       <xs:element ref="fx_profile_abstract" maxOccurs="unbounded">
  * 1.5: <xs:group ref="fx_profile_group" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
  * 1.4: We would need to inject a sub ModelGroup (xs:choice). That means
    a switch from simple children counting to StateMachine.


- check weird compiler errors under OSX:
  * "fixed1" and "half4x4" as members of validation data structs are not compilable


- create typedefs for c primitive types to hide compiler specific type sizes.
  * specify more OSs, compilers, archs (specify in COLLADABU)
prio: 1


- support for variety union
  * not supported:
  * xsi:type
  * lists as member types
  * nested unions
  * simple type validation for member types
prio: 1


- URI class is not used in generated code
  * only used for variety atomic because of deep copy problem
  * atomic URIs are returned/passed by value
prio: 1


- attrs as list/union/uri with default values are not supported (test 09)
  * after attribute parsing, we check if they are present
    and set default values if they are not. If they don't have default values
    we create new/empty objects (on default C stack).
    Thus memcpy is called for objects but they are overwritten by an object
    created with c-tor.
prio: 2


- API to manipulate function map
  * generate special function maps for children of given element
  * currently supported: all children, only direct children
  * maybe useful: given children depth (e.g. to gather geometry IDs), ...
  * maybe useful: use children blacklist (e.g. to exclude <float_array> or <p>)
  * handle substitution groups for that
prio: 2



- XML namespaces
  * XSD built-in attributes (not supported):
      xsi:type
      xsi:nil
      xsi:schemaLocation
      xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation
  * attributes from xml-infoset (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#infoitem.element):
      xmlns
      xmlns:<name>
  * xml-infoset attributes are allowed for each element, supporting them only 
    for (1) root element, (2) first element from different namespace, (3) where xs:any is allowed
  * xml-infoset attributes are handled in hand-written code, thus hashes are calculated
    two times (xmlns) or three times (xmlns:<name>)
  * we have "namespace handlers" to allow implementors using their own namespaces
  * additional we have one "unknown element handler"
  * targetNamespace is optional
  * we use variant of calcHash which returns always 2 hashes (nsPrefix and element name)
  * COLLADA specifies <xs:annotation>/<xs:appinfo>enable-xmlns</xs:appinfo>
  * we include configurable namespace name in method names if necessary
  * we have laxNamespaceHandling to call generated methods when ns is not declared
  * mathml presentation is not supported
  * namespaces for attributes are not supported
  * xml:base is a special case and it is supported. xml must always be bound to 
    http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace and that namespace must always be bound to the prefix xml.
    And it is allowed to use xml:base without declaring the namespace xml.
    For COLLADA-DOM it must be xml_base.
    <COLLADA xml:base=""

- atomic chardata is always copied because we don't know if it is complete (at least numeric, not sure about strings)
  * with 'prefix buffers' in characterData2Data() it is the same.
prio: 3


- StackMemoryManager does not allocate additional memory
  * handle case that no more mem could be allocated in calling code
     # newObject() in hand written code:
       ParserTemplate::characterData2Data() 3 times
       ParserTemplate::characterData2EnumData 3 times
       ParserTemplate::characterData2List 1 time

       ParserTemplateBase::toDataPrefix 2 times
     # growObject() in hand written code:
       ParserTemplate::characterData2List 1 time
  * in case new mem has to be allocated multiple times in one call, we have some unused blobs
  * when one blob is nearly filled, and new objects are allocated and deleted
    it may happen that std::new and std::delete are called every time

prio: 3


- COLLADA: optional attribute "maxInclusive" of element "int_array" does not use a XSD mechanism 
  for validation and is ignored (same applies to magnitude and float_array)
  -> generator flag / type mapping->xsd-double to c++-float *NO* we need doubles for BREP

- empty elements cause errors (if they may have char data, e.g. <source_data />)
prio: 4

- strings as enums and chardata do ignore whitespaces
prio: 4

- each simpleType may define own whitespace rules. Not supported.
prio: 4

- we should strip whitespaces off strings for atomic chardata/attrs (at least sometimes)
prio: 4

- enums for attributes with variety list are missing
prio: 4

- if enums are further restricted in sub types, these restrictions are ignored.
prio: 4

- generate java code
prio: 5

- support for wildcards (e.g. <xs:any/>)
  * required to handle elements allowed in COLLADA as unknown under technique
  * generating always code as if:
    -> namespace = ##any
    -> processContents = lax
  * xs:any is implicit present by usage of xs:anyType. In COLLADA e.g. <init_as_null>.
prio: 5

- float compares in conjunction with enums may fail (-> may cause that data() function is not called for enum lists)
prio: 5



- elements with mixed content may cause compiler errors in generated code
- counters in complex type validation data may overflow
- not supported: validation of <a/><b/><a/> inside sequence (could be done with nested model group)
- not supported: minOccurs/maxOccrs with other values than 0,1,unbounded in nested model group 
  (e.g. <sequence><choice maxOccurs=5></choice></sequence>)
- create C++ clases for types like date-time
- simple type validation for atomic-data-strings:
  * whitespaces are NOT ignored
  * when error is ignored by error handler it may occur several times
- length validation for enum lists is missing
- if parsing of an attribute list fails, error message contains parent element
- No support for: <xs:attribute use="prohibited"
- differences between xs:extension and xs:restriction are ignored
- pattern validation: unicode is not supported, whitespaces are NOT ignored
- pattern validation: pcre does not support set operations. Thus we have COLLADA 1.5 specific
                      code in generator.
                      A link which documents perl's lack of set substraction:
                      http://search.cpan.org/dist/Unicode-Regex-Set/Set.pm 
- if multiple patterns are defined, only the last one is used.
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#rf-pattern
  4.3.4.2 XML Representation of pattern Schema Components

- if URI as attribute is required we generate a present flag. Maybe this should be changed. 

- unsupported simple type validations:
    * length for hexBinary or base64Binary or QName or NOTATION or string lists
    * minLength for hexBinary or base64Binary or QName or NOTATION or string lists
    * maxLength for hexBinary or base64Binary or QName or NOTATION or string lists
    * whiteSpace (<xs:whiteSpace value="preserve"/>)
    * pattern for other types than atomic strings (strings as list items are supported)
    * totalDigits
    * fractionDigits
    * maxScale
    * minScale
    * Assertions


- nice to have: when an element is invalid, don't cancel completely, cancel just it's parent.
- nice to have: info which elements are expected in nested model group error messages.
- nice to have: toInteger should check max/min values (-> simple vali of built in types).
- nice to have: when char data parsing fails, element name is not included in error message
