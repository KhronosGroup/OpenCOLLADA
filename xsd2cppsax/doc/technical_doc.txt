2. About generated code
***********************
The main thing are two big parser classes (private parser and public parser) and some helper stuff. The two parser classes
contain several methods for each element in input XSD. The public parser is intended to be subclassed by implementors
it contains two or three methods per element: begin, end, and if necessary: data. As some XML formats are pretty complex 
it is convenient to parse different parts of an input file with different specialized classes. To respect that it is
possible to change the public parser implementation at runtime.
The private parser contains more methods per element:
begin, end, data, preBegin, preEnd, validateBegin, validateEnd. At the beginning the code in the 'pre' and 'validate'
methods was all in 'validate'. This has been changed to put validation code into it's own source file. If you read
generator code you may find stuff called 'validate' which ends up in 'pre' methods.

The validateBegin and validateEnd methods are obviously for validation. The preBegin and preEnd methods are used to
parse text from XML (attributes and char data). The private parser (and thus implementors) never get to see the plain XML
text data. They get always parsed binary data.

Generated methods of private parser are called by it's base class: GeneratedSaxParser::ParserTemplate. This base class is
a C++ template and needs two type parameters: generated private (DerivedClass) and public (ImplClass) parser. ParserTemplate
recieves SAX calls from plain XML libraries, like libxml or expat. Thoes libraries pass in an element name. ParserTemplate
has to map that element name to a generated method of private parser. To increase performance string compares are avoided when
dealing with element names. Instead strings are hashed (GeneratedSaxParser::Utils::calculateStringHash()). As element names
are not unique in XSD it is not enough to hash the element name received by libxml and call a generated method by that.

Samll example XSD with non-unique element names (child is not unique):
	<xs:complexType name="parent1Type">
		<xs:sequence>
			<xs:element name="child" type="xs:int"/>
		</xs:sequence>
	</xs:complexType>
	<xs:complexType name="parent2Type">
		<xs:sequence>
			<xs:element name="child" type="xs:string"/>
		</xs:sequence>
	</xs:complexType>
	<xs:element name="root">
		<xs:complexType>
			<xs:sequence>
				<xs:element name="parent1" type="parent1Type" />
				<xs:element name="parent2" type="parent2Type" />
			</xs:sequence>
		</xs:complexType>
	</xs:element>

To get an unique ID for all elements in XSD one special function is generated: findElementHash(). That method contains a big
switch-case block which uses an ID of the current parent-element-type and the current element name to find that unique element
ID. The parent-element-type is created at begin of generation. It is just a number for each type present in input XSD.

After the unique element ID has been obtained, ParserTemplate has to map it to generated methods of private parser. Therefore
a big function map is generated. It contains the unique element ID as key and a struct with member-function-pointers as value.
That struct contains the methods of private parser which belong to current element.

A second generated map is nameMap. That one contains a mapping of element and attribute hashes to their names. It is used
for error handling.

ParserTemplate needs two more special functions. One is used to find out if any element is allowed in current element: isXsAnyAllowed().
If that method returns true, GeneratedSaxParser::IUnknownElementHandler is used. The other method is called isDifferentNamespaceAllowed.
That one is used to decide if current attributes shall be searched for XML namespace declarations with xmlns. After XML specs that 
namespace handling should be done at every element. But to increase performance it is only done at elements which reference children
from different namespaces.

Validation is split up in two different parts: complex type validation and simple type validation. Complex type validation means to check
if child elements are allowed. Therefore it is necessary to validate the order in which child elements occur and to count how often
a child element occurrs. Complex type validation gets more complicated when nested model groups are involved (that means e.g. a xs:sequence
inside a xs:choice). In that case a state machine is used to find out if child elements are allowed. The state machine objects exist
only at generation time. At runtime only interger compares take place. To implement these two kinds of complex type validation a
validation struct is generated for each type. It contains members to count children or to update state machine.

Simple type validation means to reduce allowed values. E.g. a float type which must be between 0.0 and 1.0. Or a list which must have at
least 5 items. To ensure that a validation function is generated for each simple type. These functions are called during parsing of
attributes and char data. As libxml passes char data chunk wise, we never know when char data are complete. To ensure that max length
is not exeeded somewhen in the middle of several data-method calls, special 'stream' and 'streamEnd' validation functions are generated.
'stream' is called during each data-method call and 'streamEnd' when char data are completed, that means during 'preEnd'.



3. About code generator
***********************
The Sax Parser Generator uses apache xerces to parse the input XSD. It uses the xerces XSD model, too. That model is traversed element
wise using abstract classes:
- AbstractXSTraverser
- AbstractStackBasedTraverser

Before real code generation can start several information has to be gathered about input XSD. Therefore several sub classes of these
traversers are used (see javadoc for details):
- CppConstantsCreator
- CppElementNameCreator
- CppValidationDataStructNameCreator
- ElementUsageCollector
- SubstitutionGroupResolver

Beside these traversers IDs for XSD types are generated. These infos are made available to several classes through interface
IGenerationDataProvider.

After information gathering output files are setup. In that steps are printed header comments, includes, class declarations
and other stuff which does not depent on an element wise traversal.

Afterwards the actual code generation starts. Required methods are printed to public and private parser files for each element.
If necessary additional things like attribute structures, validation structures and functions, enums and unions are printed
along the way.

As generator and generated code should be independent, code templates are used. These are split up in two kinds: type dependent
and type independent. Type dependent ones are defined in package de.netallied.xsd2cppsax.TypeMapping. Type independent ones
are defined in a config file. That file is referenced in global generator config file via option 'codeTemplates'. These code
templates contain placeholders to be filled in during generation. These placeholders start and end with a '#' character. They
reference things like current element name or validation function for current XSD type. All allowed placeholders are defined in
class 'Constants' and are obtaind through class 'Config'. The replacement of placeholders with their values is done by class
'TemplateEngine'. As some code templates reference other code templates recursive replacement is required in some cases.
